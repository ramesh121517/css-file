    <h1>What are the disadvantages of CSS?</h1>
    <p>Now that we've explored what are the advantages of CSS, let us take a look at what are the disadvantages of CSS.

        <li>Browser Compatibility</li>
        <li>Learning Curve</li>
        <li>Lack of Security</li>

    <h1> What is the difference between CSS2 and CSS3?</h1>
    <P>The biggest difference between CSS2 and CSS3 is that CSS3 has been split into different sections, called modules.
        Each of these modules is making its way through in various stages of the recommendation process. This
        process has made it much easier for various pieces of CSS3 to be accepted and implemented in the browser by
        different manufacturers.</P>
    <p>If you compare this process to what happened with CSS2, where everything was submitted as a single document with
        all the Cascading Style Sheets information within it, you begin to see the advantages of breaking the
        recommendation up into smaller, individual pieces. Because each of the modules is being worked on individually,
        developers enjoy a much wider range of browser support for CSS3 modules.</p>

    <h1> How can the background color of an element be changed?</h1>
    <p>To add background color in HTML, use the CSS background-color property. Set it to the color name or code you want
        and place it inside a style attribute. Then add this style attribute to an HTML element, like a table, heading,
        div, or span tag.</p>

        achieved by using the background-repeat property that will help us to control the repetition of the image.</p>

        also decides whether the background image will be repeated or not.</p>

        relative to the position layer set by background-origin .</p>

    <!-- Ten Questions -->
    <h1>Why should background and color be used as separate properties? </h1>

        further increase.

    <h1>How to center block elements using CSS1?</h1>
    <p>Center Block elements using margin Property :
        <br>width of 100% of the the webpages the block.
        <br>center block elements, we primarily rely on the `margin` property. Since block elements span the full width
        of
        their container, we adjust their margins to position them horizontally and vertically. Notably, the `text-align:
        center` property doesnot center block elements; it only affects non-block or inline-block elements.

    <h1>How to maintain the CSS specifications? </h1>
    <p>Specificity is the algorithm used by browsers to determine the CSS declaration that is the most relevant to an
        element, which in turn, determines the property value to apply to the element. The specificity algorithm
        calculates the weight of a CSS selector to determine which rule from competing CSS declarations gets applied to
        an element. <br>Increase the specificity of the selector of the formerly !important declaration so that it is
        greater than other declarations</p>

    <h1>What are the ways to integrate CSS as a web page?</h1>
    <p>When a browser reads a style sheet, it will format the HTML document according to the information in the style
        sheet.</p>
    <p>An internal style sheet may be used if one single HTML page has a unique style.
        <br> The internal style is defined inside the style element, inside the head section.
    </p>
    <!-- Fourteen Questions -->
    <h1>What is embedded style sheets?</h1>
    <p>CSS files can be embedded internally by declaring them in style tag. This decreases the load time of the webpage.
        Although embedded CSS declarations allow dynamic styles, it should be downloaded at every page request as
        internal CSS can't be cached. Internal CSS are declared in style tag inside head tag</p>

        <br> - Classes can be created for use on multiple HTML element types in many documents.
        <br> - In complex situations, selector and grouping methods can be used to apply styles.
        <br>The disadvantages of External Style Sheets are:
        <br> - In order to import style information for each document, an extra download is needed.
        <br> - Until the external style sheet is loaded, it may not be possible to render the document.

    <h1>What are the media types allowed by CSS?</h1>
    <p>The @media rule, introduced in CSS2, made it possible to define different style rules for different media
        types.
        <br>Media queries in CSS3 extended the CSS2 media types idea: Instead of looking for a type of device, they look
        at the capability of the device.
        <br>Media queries can be used to check many things, such as:
        <br>width and height of the viewport
        <br>orientation of the viewport (landscape or portrait)
        <br>resolution
        <br>Using media queries are a popular technique for delivering a tailored style sheet to desktops, laptops,
        tablets, and mobile phones (such as iPhone and Android phones).
